Hey guys! This is great!

## Architecture
Each folder is for a page (or a modal). Each folder should probably have three files in it: index.html, page.css, page.js.

The exception is the common folder. That is for the header, footer, and tommy's database connections.

## Running It Locally with Python
* Navigate to the base of the repo
* Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
* Go to `http://localhost:8000/` in your favorite browser (obviously Chrome)
* I've only tested this on Mac. No guarantees for Windows
